## Review Focus Areas

### 1. OpenAPI and SDK Updates (PR #18)

#### Key Files to Review:
- OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`)
- SDK generated files
- Version information

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that the OpenAPI version is properly bumped
- [ ] Check that the `generated_at` timestamp is added to `SimulationResults`
- [ ] Ensure that SDK files are correctly synchronized with the specification
- [ ] Confirm that changes are backward compatible
- [ ] Test the updated SDK with existing code

### 2. Artifact Cleanup (PR #25)

#### Key Files to Review:
- Old API backup files
- Backup directory structure
- Log files and Cypress screenshots
- `.gitignore` updates

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that only unnecessary files are being removed
- [ ] Check that the `.gitignore` is updated to ignore future log and screenshot artifacts
- [ ] Ensure that no important data is being deleted
- [ ] Confirm that the cleanup is comprehensive
- [ ] Test that the application still works after cleanup

### 3. Code Organization (PR #26)

#### Key Files to Review:
- Analysis helper modules
- Experimental directory structure
- Portfolio optimization modules

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that unused analysis helpers are correctly moved to `experimental/`
- [ ] Check that the old `portfolio_optimization.py` module is properly replaced
- [ ] Ensure that no functionality is lost in the reorganization
- [ ] Confirm that imports are updated where necessary
- [ ] Test that the application still works after reorganization

### 4. Frontend Cleanup (PR #27)

#### Key Files to Review:
- Unused JavaScript scripts
- Old API backup files

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that only unused scripts are being removed
- [ ] Check for any potential dependencies on the removed files
- [ ] Ensure that no functionality is lost
- [ ] Confirm that the cleanup is comprehensive
- [ ] Test that the frontend still works after cleanup

### 5. Logging Improvements (PR #29)

#### Key Files to Review:
- Server startup code
- IRR fixing utilities
- Portfolio generation helpers
- Abu Dhabi script
- Test simulation code
- Websocket test code

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that print statements are properly replaced with logging calls
- [ ] Check that appropriate log levels are used
- [ ] Ensure that log messages are informative and consistent
- [ ] Confirm that logging configuration is properly set up
- [ ] Test that logs are correctly generated during application execution

### 6. Fee Drag Calculation (PR #30)

#### Key Files to Review:
- Gross performance metrics calculation
- Fee drag computation logic
- Documentation of fee drag calculation

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that the placeholder fee drag calculation is removed
- [ ] Check that fee drag is now computed only against fund-level metrics
- [ ] Ensure that the documentation clearly explains the fee drag calculation
- [ ] Confirm that the changes produce correct results
- [ ] Test the fee drag calculation with different scenarios

## Integration Strategy

The recommended integration order for this batch is:

1. PR #25: Cleanup backup and log artifacts (file cleanup)
2. PR #26: Remove redundant and unused analysis modules (code organization)
3. PR #27: Remove unused frontend scripts (frontend cleanup)
4. PR #29: Replace print statements with logging (logging improvements)
5. PR #30: Update fee drag calculation (calculation logic)
6. PR #18: Update OpenAPI spec and SDK (API and SDK updates)

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Breaking Changes**: Ensure that removing unused code and files doesn't break existing functionality.

2. **Logging Configuration**: Verify that logging is properly configured and doesn't impact performance.

3. **SDK Compatibility**: Check that SDK updates maintain compatibility with existing code.

4. **Fee Drag Accuracy**: Ensure that the updated fee drag calculation produces correct and expected results.

5. **Documentation Consistency**: Verify that documentation is updated to reflect changes in code organization and calculations.

## Post-Integration Verification

After integrating these PRs, verify:

1. The correct functioning of the application after file cleanup
2. The proper generation of logs instead of console output
3. The accuracy of fee drag calculations
4. The compatibility of the updated SDK with existing code
5. The overall code quality and organization improvements
