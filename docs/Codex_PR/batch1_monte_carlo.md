## Integration Strategy

The recommended integration order for this batch is:

1. PR #15: Add inner Monte Carlo runner (foundational implementation)
2. PR #16: Add inner Monte Carlo support (controller integration)
3. PR #17: Add inner Monte Carlo config options (schema updates)
4. PR #22: Add detailed Monte Carlo schema (API schema updates)
5. PR #21: Add variance analysis endpoint (backend API)
6. PR #20: Add variance analysis adapter (frontend integration)
7. PR #19: Add variance analysis config options (UI configuration)
8. PR #23: Update docs for inner Monte Carlo and variance API (documentation)
9. PR #24: Add inner Monte Carlo tests (testing)

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Performance Impact**: Inner Monte Carlo simulations can be computationally expensive. Verify that the implementation includes appropriate optimizations and doesn't significantly degrade performance.

2. **Memory Usage**: Check for potential memory issues with nested simulations, especially with large datasets.

3. **UI Responsiveness**: Ensure that the frontend remains responsive when processing and displaying complex Monte Carlo results.

4. **API Consistency**: Verify that the new endpoints maintain consistency with existing API patterns and naming conventions.

5. **Test Coverage**: Given the complexity of Monte Carlo simulations, ensure comprehensive test coverage, including edge cases and error conditions.

## Post-Integration Verification

After integrating these PRs, verify:

1. The ability to configure and run inner Monte Carlo simulations
2. The generation and display of variance analysis results
3. The correct functioning of all related UI components
4. The performance impact on the overall system
5. The accuracy of the simulation results
