# Batch 6: Advanced Visualization and Export Features

This document provides detailed review guidelines for the Advanced Visualization and Export Features PRs.

## PRs in this Batch

- PR #40: Add Monte Carlo and frontier visualizations
- PR #41: Add optimization endpoints
- PR #42: Implement simulation export endpoints

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Frontend Visualization Components (PR #40)

#### Key Files to Review:
- `MonteCarloResults` and `EfficientFrontierChart` component implementations
- Hooks for fetching Monte Carlo and efficient frontier data
- Zustand store extensions
- SDK wrapper for new API calls
- Advanced tab UI integration

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify the implementation of the Monte Carlo visualization components
- [ ] Check that the efficient frontier chart correctly displays optimization results
- [ ] Ensure that data fetching hooks are properly implemented
- [ ] Confirm that the Zustand store is correctly extended for new state management
- [ ] Check that the SDK wrapper properly interfaces with the API
- [ ] Verify that visualizations are correctly integrated into the Advanced tab
- [ ] Test the components with different data scenarios

### 2. Portfolio Optimization Endpoints (PR #41)

#### Key Files to Review:
- OpenAPI specification for optimization endpoints
- POST route for running optimizations
- GET route for retrieving efficient frontier data
- Helper routes in `simulation_api`

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that optimization endpoints are properly defined in the OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Check that the POST route correctly handles optimization requests
- [ ] Ensure that the GET route properly returns efficient frontier data
- [ ] Confirm that helper routes in `simulation_api` correctly run the optimizer
- [ ] Check for proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Verify that the endpoints are well-documented
- [ ] Test the endpoints with various input parameters

### 3. Simulation Export Functionality (PR #42)

#### Key Files to Review:
- `/loans/` endpoint implementation
- JSON and CSV export functionality
- Test coverage for new endpoints

#### Review Checklist:
- [ ] Verify that the `/loans/` endpoint correctly lists loans from stored results
- [ ] Check that JSON export functionality works as expected
- [ ] Ensure that CSV export functionality correctly formats data
- [ ] Confirm that tests adequately cover the new endpoints
- [ ] Check for proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Verify that exports include all necessary data
- [ ] Test the export functionality with different simulation results

## Integration Strategy

The recommended integration order for this batch is:

1. PR #41: Add optimization endpoints (backend API)
2. PR #42: Implement simulation export endpoints (backend API)
3. PR #40: Add Monte Carlo and frontier visualizations (frontend integration)

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Data Format Consistency**: Ensure that the data format returned by the backend endpoints matches what the frontend visualization components expect.

2. **Performance Considerations**: Check for potential performance issues when exporting large simulation results or generating complex visualizations.

3. **Error Handling**: Verify that the components and endpoints properly handle error cases, such as missing data or failed optimizations.

4. **UI Responsiveness**: Ensure that the frontend remains responsive when loading and displaying complex visualizations.

5. **Export File Size**: Check that large exports are handled efficiently and don't cause memory issues.

## Post-Integration Verification

After integrating these PRs, verify:

1. The correct display of Monte Carlo and efficient frontier visualizations in the Advanced tab
2. The proper functioning of optimization endpoints with different parameters
3. The ability to export simulation results in both JSON and CSV formats
4. The completeness and accuracy of exported data
5. The overall user experience when working with these advanced features
