## Conclusion

These workflows provide a comprehensive guide to the user interactions within the Simulation Module UI. They should be used in conjunction with the UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md, UI_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, and UI_DESIGN_MOCKUPS.md documents to ensure a consistent, intuitive user experience.

The workflows are designed to be efficient, logical, and user-friendly, guiding users through complex tasks with clear steps and feedback. As the implementation progresses, these workflows should be validated through user testing and refined based on feedback.
