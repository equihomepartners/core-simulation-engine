# Dashboard Redesign

## Overview

The dashboard redesign aims to create a bank-grade, professional interface for the Equihome Fund Simulation Engine. This document outlines the design principles, layout structure, and component specifications for the new dashboard.

## Design Goals

1. **Professional Financial Institution Aesthetic** - Create a clean, sophisticated interface that conveys trust and credibility
2. **Enhanced Data Visualization** - Improve the presentation of simulation data with clear, professional charts
3. **Improved Information Hierarchy** - Organize content to prioritize key metrics and actionable insights
4. **Streamlined User Experience** - Simplify workflows and reduce cognitive load
5. **Consistent Design Language** - Implement a unified design system across all components

## Layout Structure

### Landing Page

The landing page presents users with two clear options in a clean, bank-grade interface:

1. **Manual Simulation** - Configure and run simulations with full control over parameters
2. **Automated Simulations** (coming soon) - AI-driven optimization of simulations based on requirements

The layout features two large, prominent cards with clear descriptions and calls to action. The automated option is visually distinguished as a future feature.

### Main Dashboard

The main dashboard is organized into several key sections:

1. **Header** - Clear branding, navigation, notifications, and user menu
2. **Key Performance Metrics** - Prominent display of critical metrics with trend indicators
3. **Recent Simulations** - Clean, scannable table with simulation metadata and actions
4. **Summary Statistics** - Aggregate metrics showing overall system usage
5. **Quick Actions** - Clear pathways to common tasks

### Simulation Results

The simulation results dashboard is organized to provide comprehensive insights with clear navigation:

1. **Overview Tab** - Key metrics, fund parameters, and high-level insights
2. **Cashflows Tab** - Detailed cashflow analysis with various visualization options
3. **Portfolio Tab** - Zone allocation, loan distribution, and portfolio evolution
4. **Returns Tab** - Comprehensive return metrics and waterfall distributions
5. **GP Economics Tab** - Management company performance and carried interest analysis
6. **Monte Carlo Tab** - Probability distributions and sensitivity analysis

## Component Specifications

### Top-Level Navigation

- **Primary Navigation** - Vertical sidebar with clear icons and labels
- **Secondary Navigation** - Horizontal tabs for contextual navigation
- **Breadcrumbs** - Clear path indicators for nested content

### Metric Cards

- **Primary Metrics** - Large, prominent display of key metrics with trend indicators
- **Secondary Metrics** - Smaller metrics organized in contextual groups
- **Comparison Metrics** - Side-by-side metrics showing actual vs. target values

### Data Tables

- **Header Row** - Clear column labels with sorting indicators
- **Data Rows** - Subtle alternating backgrounds with hover states
- **Actions Column** - Consistent placement of row-specific actions
- **Pagination** - Clear controls for navigating large datasets

### Charts and Visualizations

- **Line Charts** - For time series data (cashflows, portfolio value)
- **Bar Charts** - For categorical comparisons (zone performance, yearly returns)
- **Pie/Donut Charts** - For composition data (portfolio allocation)
- **Stacked Charts** - For showing component breakdowns over time
- **Hybrid Charts** - Combining bars and lines for multi-dimensional data

### Interactive Controls

- **Date Range Selectors** - For filtering time-based data
- **Toggles and Checkboxes** - For showing/hiding data series
- **Dropdowns** - For selecting visualization options
- **Tooltips** - For providing additional context and data points

## Color Usage

- **Primary Data** - Deep navy blue (#0A2463)
- **Secondary Data** - Medium blue (#3E92CC)
- **Positive Values** - Forest green (#2E7D32)
- **Negative Values** - Deep red (#C62828)
- **Neutral Values** - Medium gray (#546E7A)
- **Backgrounds** - Ultra light gray (#F5F7F9) and white (#FFFFFF)

## Typography Guidelines

- **Metric Values** - Bold (600), 18-24px, high emphasis
- **Metric Labels** - Medium (500), 14px, medium emphasis
- **Table Headers** - Medium (500), 14px, dark gray
- **Table Data** - Regular (400), 14px, medium gray
- **Chart Titles** - Medium (500), 16px, dark gray
- **Chart Labels** - Regular (400), 12px, medium gray
- **Chart Axes** - Regular (400), 12px, light gray

## Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop (>1200px)** - Full feature set with multi-column layout
- **Tablet (768-1200px)** - Condensed layout with fewer columns
- **Mobile (<768px)** - Stacked layout with prioritized content and simplified visualizations

## Implementation Approach

1. **Theme Update** - Implement the new color palette, typography, and spacing
2. **Component Restyling** - Update individual components to match the new design system
3. **Layout Restructuring** - Reorganize dashboard layouts for better information hierarchy
4. **Chart Enhancements** - Improve data visualization components
5. **Responsive Refinement** - Ensure optimal experience across all device sizes

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Metrics Presentation** - Clearer display of key metrics with context and trends
2. **Improved Table Design** - More scannable tables with better information density
3. **Refined Chart Aesthetics** - More professional, cleaner charts with better labeling
4. **Clearer Navigation** - More intuitive navigation with better hierarchy
5. **More Accessible UI** - Better color contrast and keyboard navigation
6. **Cohesive Visual Identity** - Consistent application of design language
7. **Clearer User Guidance** - Better tooltips, help text, and onboarding elements
