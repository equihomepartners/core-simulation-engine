# GP Model Documentation

## Overview

The GP Model is an extension of the Equihome Fund Simulation Engine that provides comprehensive modeling of the General Partner (GP) entity, Equihome Partners. This model allows for detailed financial analysis of the GP's economics, including management company operations, team economics, and cross-fund performance.

## Documentation Structure

This folder contains the following documentation:

1. [**ARCHITECTURE.md**](ARCHITECTURE.md): Detailed architecture of the GP Model, including components, data models, and integration points.

2. [**REQUIREMENTS.md**](REQUIREMENTS.md): Comprehensive requirements for the GP Model, including functional and non-functional requirements.

3. [**IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md): Phased implementation plan for the GP Model, including tasks, deliverables, and timeline.

4. [**TESTING_PLAN.md**](TESTING_PLAN.md): Comprehensive testing plan for the GP Model, including test cases, test data, and test schedule.

## Key Features

The GP Model provides the following key features:

1. **GP Economics Aggregation**: Aggregates management fees, carried interest, and other revenue streams across multiple funds and tranches.

2. **Management Company Modeling**: Models the operational aspects of the GP entity, including expenses, staff, and revenue diversification.

3. **Team Economics Modeling**: Models the distribution of economics among the GP team, including partners and employees.

4. **GP Entity Modeling**: Provides a comprehensive model of the GP entity, including GP commitment, cross-fund carry, and other parameters.

5. **Cashflow and Metrics Calculation**: Generates detailed cashflows and calculates key performance metrics for the GP entity.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**: Provides comprehensive visualizations and reports for GP entity economics.

7. **Integration with Existing System**: Integrates seamlessly with the existing Equihome Fund Simulation Engine.

## Integration with Existing Architecture

The GP Model integrates with the existing architecture through the following interfaces:

1. **MultiFundManager Integration**: The GP Model integrates with the MultiFundManager class to aggregate GP economics across multiple funds.

2. **TrancheManager Integration**: The GP Model integrates with the TrancheManager class to aggregate GP economics across multiple tranches.

3. **API Integration**: The GP Model provides API endpoints for GP entity configuration, calculation, and visualization.

4. **UI Integration**: The GP Model provides UI components for GP entity configuration and visualization.

## Implementation Timeline

The GP Model will be implemented in the following phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core GP Economics Aggregation** (2 weeks)
2. **Phase 2: Management Company Modeling** (2 weeks)
3. **Phase 3: Team Economics Modeling** (2 weeks)
4. **Phase 4: GP Entity Model Integration** (2 weeks)
5. **Phase 5: Cashflow and Metrics Calculation** (2 weeks)
6. **Phase 6: API and UI Integration** (3 weeks)
7. **Phase 7: Advanced Features and Optimization** (3 weeks)

**Total Duration: 16 weeks**
