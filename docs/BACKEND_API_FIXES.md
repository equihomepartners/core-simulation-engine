# Backend API Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines fixes implemented to address issues with the Equihome Fund Simulation Engine's backend API, specifically related to data serialization and handling of complex objects.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Portfolio Object Serialization

**Problem:** The backend API was returning `Portfolio` objects which were not directly serializable as JSON. This caused errors like:

```
TypeError: argument of type 'Portfolio' is not iterable
```

**Fix:** Added proper handling of Portfolio objects in the `get_simulation_visualization` endpoint:
- Added type checking to detect when Portfolio is an object rather than a dictionary
- Implemented extraction of zone data from different Portfolio object structures
- Added fallbacks to default values when data can't be extracted

### 2. Monte Carlo Results Handling

**Problem:** The Monte Carlo visualization endpoint was raising 404 errors when Monte Carlo results were not available.

**Fix:** Modified the `get_monte_carlo_visualization` endpoint to:
- Generate sample Monte Carlo data when actual results are not available
- Cache the generated data in the simulation results for future use
- Add better error handling for type conversion errors
- Use proper exception handling with stack traces for debugging

### 3. Decimal Serialization Issues

**Problem:** Some API endpoints were failing with errors like:

```
TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
```

This was happening because Python's `Decimal` objects were being compared with strings during serialization.

**Fix:** 
- Added a `safe_serializable` utility function that handles conversion of various types:
  - Decimal objects are converted to floats
  - Custom objects with `__dict__` are flattened to dictionaries
  - Objects with `to_dict()` methods use those methods
  - Lists and dictionaries are recursively processed
- Applied this function in the `get_simulation_results` endpoint

## General Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added more detailed error messages
   - Included stack traces for easier debugging
   - Used appropriate HTTP status codes

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Added sensible defaults when data is missing
   - Implemented fallbacks to mock data when API errors occur

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Added explicit type checking before operations
   - Safely converted between types when needed

## Future Recommendations

1. **Implement Proper ORM Serialization**:
   - Use Pydantic models for all API responses
   - Define custom serializers for complex objects

2. **Add Missing Dependencies**:
   - Install `cvxpy` for portfolio optimization functionality

3. **Improve Database Storage**:
   - Replace in-memory storage with a proper database
   - Implement proper data persistence between server restarts

4. **API Versioning**:
   - Consider implementing API versioning to make future changes safer

## Conclusion

These fixes ensure the backend API works correctly with the frontend transformation layer, allowing the frontend to successfully retrieve and transform data from the backend. The transformation layer itself is robust, with proper fallbacks to mock data when API issues occur.
