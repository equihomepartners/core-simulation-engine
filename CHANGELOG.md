## [Unreleased] Waterfall Accuracy Patch (2025‑05‑XX)

### Fixed
- **Capital‑call sign handling** in `waterfall.py`: now sums the *absolute* value of `capital_calls` so committed capital is measured correctly. This removes profit inflation caused by negative cash‑flow sign mix‑up.
- **Sanity guard** in European waterfall: raises error if GP+LP distributions exceed available cash.

### Added
- **disable_carry_when_no_commitment** flag (default `true`) respected in both European and American waterfalls. When GP commitment is zero and the flag is true, carried‑interest rate is forced to 0 to reflect a manager‑only GP structure unless explicitly overridden.
