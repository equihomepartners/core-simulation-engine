# Audit Report: simulation_controller.py (April 2024)

## Summary
This document records the results of a deep audit of `simulation_controller.py` and all code changes made to address key issues. The audit focused on maintainability, robustness, type safety, error handling, and production-readiness.

## Key Issues Found
1. **Config Mutation:** The input config dictionary was mutated in-place, risking side effects.
2. **Mock Fallbacks:** Missing dependencies could be silently ignored in production.
3. **Schema Validation:** Schema validation failures were not always hard errors.
4. **Granularity Handling:** Monthly/yearly logic was duplicated in several places.
5. **Division by Zero:** Analytics could mask data issues by defaulting to 1.
6. **Logging:** Potential for logging sensitive data and unhandled callback errors.
7. **Type Safety:** Dictionaries were used for config/results without strict typing.
8. **Code Duplication:** Simulation step methods repeated common patterns.

## Additions and Improvements

### 1. Deep Copy of Config
- In `__init__`, the input config is now deep-copied to avoid mutation side effects:
  ```python
  config = copy.deepcopy(config)
  ```

### 2. TypedDicts for Config and Results
- Added `SimulationConfig` and `SimulationResults` TypedDicts for stricter type safety and documentation.
  ```python
  class SimulationConfig(TypedDict, total=False):
      ...
  class SimulationResults(TypedDict, total=False):
      ...
  ```
- Used these types for `self.config` and `self.results`.

### 3. Logging Warnings for Missing Dependencies
- When a core dependency (e.g., `monte_carlo`) is missing, a warning is logged:
  ```python
  except ImportError as e:
      logger.warning(f"Production dependency missing: {e}")
  ```

### 4. Schema Validation is a Hard Error
- If the schema file is missing or invalid, a `ValueError` is raised unless `dev_mode` is set in config:
  ```python
  if not self.config.get('dev_mode', False):
      raise ValueError(...)
  ```

### 5. Granularity Handling Utility
- Added `_handle_granularity()` to centralize and normalize granularity-related config logic.

### 6. Division by Zero Logging
- Added `_calculate_recycling_ratio()` utility to log and raise an error if initial loans is zero.

### 7. Progress Callback Error Handling
- Wrapped the progress callback in a try/except block to prevent it from breaking the simulation:
  ```python
  if self.progress_callback:
      try:
          self.progress_callback(...)
      except Exception as cb_err:
          logger.warning(...)
  ```

### 8. General Code Comments
- All audit-driven changes are clearly commented with `# --- Audit Fix: ... ---` for traceability.
